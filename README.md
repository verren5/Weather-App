# Weather-App

This repository contains a personal project I've been working on for practice and learning purposes. It is not intended for production use and serves as a sandbox for experimenting with various technologies and coding concepts.

A simple weather app using ReactJS.
The main functionality of this application is to fetch and present the current temperature in Celsius for a chosen city. Additionally, it offers clothing recommendations tailored to the prevailing weather conditions. Moreover, it directs users to Instagram feeds where they can find outfit inspiration from content creators that matches the current season.
